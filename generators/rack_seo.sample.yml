# default is the fallback for any paths that you have not specified

default: 
  # title_format is a ruby string which parses out anything between {{
  # and }} as a CSS selector (using Nokogiri)
  title_format: "{{h1}} - Acme Ltd"
  # meta_description_selector lets you specify where to pull the text
  # content from to extract the summary text. The default is #content,
  # falling back to the <body> tag if that isn't present. You can
  # specify your own below. It pulls out the inner text and should only
  # match one div or item.
  meta_description_selector: "#my_juicy_keyword_rich_summary_div"
  # Same as the description selector, but automatically generates a
  # comma separated list from the content provided
  meta_keywords_selector: "#my_tag_stuffed_p_tag"
# The custom key (optional) contains any paths you'd like to specify.
# These are tested against the current path, longest first to match the
# most specific by default.
custom:
  -
    matcher: '/blog'
    title_format: "The Acme Company Blog - {{#content h1}}"
    meta_description_selector: "#post_content"
    meta_keywords_selector: "#comments"
  -
    matcher: '/contact-us'
    # Plain old strings are fine too
    title_format: "How to contact us about faulty anvils"
    # You can skip the other selectors if you're happy with the
    # #content/<body> defaults
